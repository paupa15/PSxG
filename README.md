World Cup Post Shot Expected Goals (PSxG): Evaluation of performance and decision-making of the players

This repository contains my postgraduate thesis project in Sports Analytics titled "World Cup Post Shot Expected Goals (PSxG): Evaluation of performance and 
decision-making of the players." The project aims to evaluate players' decision-making at the moment of the shot to goal and to appraise the performance of players 
and goalkeepers when making shots/saves.

To accomplish these objectives, I used a Post-Shot Expected Goal (PSxG) metric that calculates the probability of scoring a goal based on the player's position, 
goalkeeper's position, and the shot's destination. I trained a data model with the events data of the World Cup (2018/2022) provided by StatsBomb, where the output 
is the PSxG.

Alsp, I have created a visualization with a heatmap that represents a matrix (3 rows x 5 columns) inside the goal, colored by the probability to score a goal. It 
allows interactivity through buttons and sliders, enabling the user to change the player and goalkeeper position and dynamically update the results. This project 
provides valuable insights into players' decision-making and performance during the World Cup.
